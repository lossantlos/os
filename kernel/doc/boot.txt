Booting process
===============

1. bootloader is loading the kernel to the RAM (to 1MB exactly)
2. bootloader is giving control to the kernel (jumping to entry point)
3. setting up ebp and esp register for stack
4. pushing multiboot header and magic number (in eax and ebx) to stack
5. initializing paging
6. setting up stack to higher half memory
7. jumping to higher half
8. calling kernel_early and kernel main
